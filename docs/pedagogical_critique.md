# Pedagogical Critique

**Clarity:** Improved with step-by-step runbook and copy/paste prompts.  
**Conciseness:** Guides split into install vs workflow.  
**Robustness:** CI, commitlint, and CODEOWNERS reduce regressions; `.gitignore` avoids noise.  
**Failsafe:** Added troubleshooting and scripts; suggest adding screenshots for non-CS students.
